# Data-Science-Projects

This is a repository which contains all of my projects that I have worked on as part of my Data Science Portfolio. I am shamelessly sharing my code (some have errors in them) but I am doing this to put myself out there and show the development and journey in my coding and how it has improved. 
If you have any questions or would like to know more please reach out to me!

Please note - I am no longer using this folder, as all of my projects are independently saved.
